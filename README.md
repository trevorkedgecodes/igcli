Alright so I really hate using Social Media apps because they suck.
So many of their apps are so obviously engineered to keep you on their and I want to break free.
I don't want to become disconnected from contact with my friends and what they share, but nothing else.
None of this algorithmic bs to show me what I want to see.
I want it formatted in a way that I can sort through the data.
Most simply, a chronological order.
I'm doing Instagram first, because it's easy, but I'll probably expand it.
